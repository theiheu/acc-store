# Unified Data Architecture

## 🎯 Overview

This document describes the unified data architecture that eliminates the disconnect between admin dashboard and homepage data. All mock data has been replaced with a single source of truth that ensures admin operations have immediate, visible effects on the user experience.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. Centralized Data Store (`src/core/data-store.ts`)

**Single Source of Truth**: All data flows through the centralized data store.

```typescript
class DataStore {
  private users: Map<string, AdminUser> = new Map();
  private products: Map<string, AdminProduct> = new Map();
  private transactions: Map<string, UserTransaction> = new Map();
  private activities: ActivityLog[] = [];
  private listeners: EventListener[] = [];
}
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Real-time event emission for all data changes
- ✅ Automatic activity logging for admin operations
- ✅ Type-safe operations with comprehensive validation
- ✅ Memory-efficient with proper cleanup mechanisms

### 2. Real-time Event System

**Event Types**:
- `USER_CREATED` - New user registration
- `USER_UPDATED` - User profile/balance changes
- `USER_BALANCE_CHANGED` - Specific balance updates
- `PRODUCT_CREATED` - New product added
- `PRODUCT_UPDATED` - Product modifications
- `PRODUCT_DELETED` - Product removal
- `TRANSACTION_CREATED` - New transaction recorded

**Event Flow**:
```
Admin Action → Data Store Update → Event Emission → SSE Broadcast → UI Update
```

### 3. Server-Sent Events (SSE) Broadcasting

**Endpoint**: `/api/events`
- Broadcasts all data changes to connected clients
- Automatic reconnection and heartbeat mechanism
- Supports multiple concurrent admin sessions

## 📊 Data Integration Points

### User Management Integration

**Before**: Mock users in admin, real authentication on homepage
**After**: Unified user system with real-time synchronization

```typescript
// Authentication callback automatically creates users
async signIn({ user, account, profile }) {
  const existingUser = dataStore.getUserByEmail(user.email);
  if (!existingUser) {
    const newUser = dataStore.createUser({
      email: user.email,
      name: user.name,
      // ... other fields
    });
    // Immediately visible in admin dashboard
  }
}
```

**Real-time Features**:
- ✅ New Google logins appear instantly in admin
- ✅ Credit top-ups update user balance immediately
- ✅ Status changes affect user access in real-time
- ✅ Transaction history syncs across all views

### Product Management Integration

**Before**: Mock admin products, separate homepage products
**After**: Single product catalog with admin extensions

```typescript
// Admin product operations affect homepage immediately
const newProduct = dataStore.createProduct({
  title: "New Product",
  price: 50000,
  // ... other fields
}, adminId, adminName);
// Product appears on homepage instantly
```

**Real-time Features**:
- ✅ New products appear on homepage without refresh
- ✅ Price/stock updates reflect immediately
- ✅ Product deactivation removes from public view
- ✅ Admin changes trigger activity logging

### Statistics and Analytics

**Before**: Hardcoded mock statistics
**After**: Real-time calculated statistics

```typescript
getStats() {
  const users = this.getUsers();
  const products = this.getProducts();
  const transactions = this.getTransactions();
  
  return {
    totalUsers: users.length,
    activeUsers: users.filter(u => u.status === 'active').length,
    totalRevenue: transactions
      .filter(tx => tx.type === 'purchase')
      .reduce((sum, tx) => sum + tx.amount, 0),
    // ... other real calculations
  };
}
```

**Real-time Features**:
- ✅ User count updates when new users register
- ✅ Revenue statistics reflect actual transactions
- ✅ Product statistics update with inventory changes
- ✅ Activity logs show real admin operations

## 🔄 Data Flow Examples

### Example 1: New User Registration

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant H as Homepage
    participant A as Auth System
    participant D as Data Store
    participant AD as Admin Dashboard
    
    U->>H: Click "Login with Google"
    H->>A: Initiate OAuth flow
    A->>D: Create user in data store
    D->>AD: Emit USER_CREATED event
    AD->>AD: Update user list in real-time
```

### Example 2: Admin Credit Top-up

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AD as Admin
    participant API as Admin API
    participant D as Data Store
    participant SSE as SSE Endpoint
    participant U as User Account Page
    
    AD->>API: POST /api/admin/users/[id]/topup
    API->>D: updateUser(balance) + createTransaction()
    D->>D: Log activity + emit events
    D->>SSE: Broadcast balance change
    SSE->>U: Real-time balance update
    U->>U: Update UI without refresh
```

### Example 3: Product Management

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AD as Admin
    participant API as Product API
    participant D as Data Store
    participant SSE as SSE Endpoint
    participant H as Homepage
    
    AD->>API: POST /api/admin/products
    API->>D: createProduct() with admin info
    D->>D: Log activity + emit PRODUCT_CREATED
    D->>SSE: Broadcast product creation
    SSE->>H: Real-time product list update
    H->>H: New product appears instantly
```

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### Automated Tests

Run the comprehensive integration test:
```bash
# Visit http://localhost:3000/test-integration
# Click "Run Integration Tests"
```

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ User creation and balance management
- ✅ Product CRUD operations with real-time sync
- ✅ Transaction recording and history
- ✅ Dashboard statistics calculation
- ✅ Activity logging and recent activity
- ✅ Cross-page data consistency

### Manual Testing

**Quick Verification**:
1. Open admin dashboard (`/admin`)
2. Open homepage (`/`) in another tab
3. In admin: Create a new product
4. In homepage: See product appear immediately
5. In admin: Add credits to a user
6. In account page: See balance update in real-time

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- ✅ Activity logs limited to 1000 entries
- ✅ Efficient Map-based data structures
- ✅ Proper event listener cleanup
- ✅ Optimized real-time updates

### Scalability
- ✅ Event-driven architecture supports multiple clients
- ✅ SSE connections handle concurrent users
- ✅ Data store operations are atomic
- ✅ Ready for database integration

## 🚀 Production Migration

### Database Integration
Replace in-memory data store with database operations:

```typescript
// Example with Prisma
async createUser(userData) {
  const user = await prisma.user.create({ data: userData });
  this.emit({ type: 'USER_CREATED', payload: user });
  return user;
}
```

### Caching Strategy
- Use Redis for real-time event broadcasting
- Implement data caching for frequently accessed data
- Add database connection pooling

### Monitoring
- Add performance metrics for data operations
- Monitor SSE connection health
- Track real-time update latency

## ✅ Benefits Achieved

### For Administrators
- ✅ **Immediate Feedback**: All changes visible instantly
