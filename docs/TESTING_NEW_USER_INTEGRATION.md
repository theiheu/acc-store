# Testing New User Integration

## 🎯 Problem Solved
When new users log in with Google on the homepage, they now automatically appear in the admin dashboard in real-time.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Authentication Integration
Updated `auth.ts` to automatically create users in the data store when they sign in:

```typescript
async signIn({ user, account, profile }) {
  if (user.email && user.name) {
    const existingUser = dataStore.getUserByEmail(user.email);
    
    if (!existingUser) {
      // Create new user in data store
      const newUser = dataStore.createUser({
        email: user.email,
        name: user.name,
        role: "user",
        status: "active",
        balance: 0,
        totalOrders: 0,
        totalSpent: 0,
        registrationSource: account?.provider || "unknown",
      });
      console.log("New user created:", newUser.email);
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

### 2. Real-time User Display
Added "Recent Users" section to admin dashboard that shows new registrations in real-time.

### 3. Event Broadcasting
New user creation triggers events that update all connected admin dashboards immediately.

## 🧪 How to Test

### Method 1: Real Google Login
1. **Open two browser tabs:**
   - Tab 1: Admin dashboard (`http://localhost:3000/admin`)
   - Tab 2: Homepage (`http://localhost:3000`)

2. **In Tab 2 (Homepage):**
   - Click "Đăng nhập" 
   - Sign in with a NEW Google account (one that hasn't been used before)
   - Complete the login process

3. **In Tab 1 (Admin Dashboard):**
   - Watch the "Người dùng mới" section
   - The new user should appear immediately without refreshing
   - Total user count should increase by 1
   - Green connection indicator should show "Cập nhật tự động"

### Method 2: Simulation Testing
1. **Open admin dashboard** (`http://localhost:3000/admin`)

2. **Open test page** (`http://localhost:3000/test-login`)

3. **In test page:**
   - Enter a new email (e.g., `newuser@example.com`)
   - Enter a name (e.g., `Nguyễn Văn Test`)
   - Click "Mô phỏng đăng nhập mới"

4. **Check admin dashboard:**
   - New user appears in "Người dùng mới" section
   - User statistics update automatically
   - No page refresh needed

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators
- **New user appears** in admin "Người dùng mới" section
- **User count increases** in dashboard statistics
- **Green pulsing dot** shows "Cập nhật tự động"
- **Toast notification** confirms user creation
- **Console log** shows "New user created: [email]"

### ❌ Troubleshooting
If new users don't appear:

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   ```
   Look for: "New user created: [email]"
   If missing: Authentication callback isn't working
   ```

2. **Check Admin Email:**
   ```typescript
   // In src/core/admin-auth.ts
   const MOCK_ADMINS = [{
     email: "YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com", // Must match your login
   }];
   ```

3. **Check Connection Status:**
   - Green dot = Connected ✅
   - Gray dot = Disconnected ❌

4. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Look for `/api/events` EventSource connection
   - Should show `text/event-stream` content type

## 🎮 Interactive Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Multiple New Users
1. Use test page to create 3-5 new users quickly
2. Watch admin dashboard update in real-time
3. Verify user count increases correctly

### Test Scenario 2: Cross-Browser Testing
1. Admin dashboard in Chrome
2. New user login in Firefox
3. Verify updates appear across browsers

### Test Scenario 3: Mobile Testing
1. Admin dashboard on desktop
2. New user login on mobile browser
3. Check real-time synchronization

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ New Google logins don't appear in admin
- ❌ User count doesn't update
- ❌ Manual refresh required to see new users

### After Fix:
- ✅ New Google logins appear instantly in admin
- ✅ User statistics update automatically
- ✅ Real-time synchronization across all tabs
- ✅ Connection status indicators work
- ✅ No page refresh needed

## 🚀 Production Considerations

### Database Integration
In production, replace the in-memory data store with:
```typescript
// Example with database
async signIn({ user, account, profile }) {
  const existingUser = await db.user.findUnique({
    where: { email: user.email }
  });
  
  if (!existingUser) {
    await db.user.create({
      data: {
        email: user.email,
        name: user.name,
        // ... other fields
      }
    });
    
    // Broadcast to all connected admin clients
    await broadcastUserCreated(newUser);
  }
}
```

### Scaling Considerations
- Use Redis for real-time event broadcasting
- Implement WebSocket for faster updates
- Add rate limiting for user creation
- Cache user data for better performance

## 🎯 Quick Verification

**One-minute test:**
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/admin` 
2. Open `http://localhost:3000/test-login`
3. Create a test user
4. See it appear instantly in admin dashboard

The integration is now working! New users from Google login will automatically appear in the admin dashboard in real-time. 🎉
